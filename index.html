            “My philosophy as an Intimacy Coordinator is to help create an
            environment that encourages creativity through care, communication
            and consent in scenes involving simulated sex, nudity, sexual
            violence and hyper exposed material in film and television. I work
            as an advocate for actors, a support for directors and the go to
            person on set for all departments, coordinating the specific needs
            of intimate scenes.”

            The role of an Intimacy Coordinator is still a relatively new one in
            Canada. Sharon began her training with Intimacy Directors
            International (now IDC - Intimacy Directors and Coordinators) in the
            United States in 2018 and continued to train through Intimacy
            Coordinators Canada. She has worked steadily as an Intimacy
            Coordinator in 2020/21 on such projects as
            <i
              >The Porter (series), Skymed (series), Esther (film), and
              Wintertide (film).</i
            >
            Sharon is currently the only Intimacy Coordinator in Manitoba,
            Canada.
