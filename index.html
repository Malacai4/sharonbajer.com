        “My philosophy as an Intimacy Coordinator is to help create an
        environment that encourages creativity through care, communication and
        consent in scenes involving simulated sex, nudity, sexual violence and
        hyper exposed material in film and television. I work as an advocate for
        actors, a support for directors and the go to person on set for all
        departments, coordinating the specific needs of intimate scenes.”

        2018 and continued to train through Intimacy Coordinators Canada. She

        projects as
